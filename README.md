# Side project challenge

Many good programmers have side projects that they work on for fun or to learn.  This weekend is a chance to work on your own side project.  You'll build something of your own choosing!

## Instructions

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am.
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own.
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**.
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning.

## Setup

* Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine.

## Choosing a project

You can build whatever you want.

### Coming up with ideas

Some possible ways of coming up with ideas:

* Maybe build something that you'd like to use.

* Maybe build something you've used before to learn how it works.

* Maybe build something that will involve solving a techncial challenge you're interested in.

* Maybe pick from this list of [project suggestions](https://github.com/karan/Projects).

### Guidelines for good projects

* Make sure you'll be able to do a Minimum Viable Product in a weekend.  Often, the best learning projects have very small MVPs, but can be expanded in many directions.

* You've only got two days, so it's probably best to use languages and frameworks you already know.

* Make sure your project is something you can write tests for.

## Implementing your project

* Write user stories before starting.

* Plan your MVP and implement that first.

* TDD, of course.

* Stick to the design/TDD/refactor loop.

* In code review we'll be hoping to see:
  * All tests passing
  * High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
  * The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

## Monday

We'll have our normal Monday morning code review.  You'll get into groups and review each other's code.  In the whole-cohort code review, some people will be randomly chosen to show their code on the projector.
